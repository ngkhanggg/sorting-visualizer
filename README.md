# Sorting Visualizer
A program that visualizes sorting algorithms, written in Java. This program allows the user to use various sorting algorithms to sort and observe how the elements are compared and swapped.
## Features
- <u>`Bubble Sort:`</u> repeatedly swaps the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- <u>`Insertion Sort:`</u> the array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part, and values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
- <u>`Merge Sort:`</u> the array is initially divided into two equal halves and then they are combined in a sorted manner.
- <u>`Quick Sort:`</u> picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.
- <u>`Selection Sort:`</u> sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
